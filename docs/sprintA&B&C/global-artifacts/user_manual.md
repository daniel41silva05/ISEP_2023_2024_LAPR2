This feature allows you to track vehicle details such as model, registration information, and maintenance schedules. Additionally, it organizes maintenance checks and manages vehicle-related tasks, ensuring vehicles are well maintained and minimizing downtime.

- #### Production of Statistical Indicators
The solution generates relevant statistical indicators to measure the performance of green space management activities, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making.
Therefore, it provides tools for analyzing the costs of water consumption in specific green spaces, this functionality being fundamental as it helps green space managers to identify areas of high consumption and possible inefficiencies and therefore reduce costs.
It also provides an analysis of equipment use by observing factors such as maintenance and usage rates, which are essential for optimizing usage strategies or even replacing certain equipment.
Finally, it also collects data through the user portal on the use of the parks, providing information on the age, frequency and recommendation of visitors, essential for customizing strategies to better attract visitors to the park.

- #### Efficient Route Selection
It employs advanced algorithms to calculate the most efficient routes for installing pipes in green spaces. This feature considers factors such as terrain, distance and water supply needs, ensuring optimal distribution of water resources. Through efficient route planning, it supports the development of efficient irrigation systems, adapted to the needs of green spaces, reducing waste of resources.


### Benefits
